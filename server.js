//should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file
// and then return the new note to the client. 
//You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved 
//(look into npm packages that could do this for you).



// Bonus
// You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application has that functionality 
// in the front end. As a bonus, see if you can add the DELETE route to the application using the 
// following guideline:

// DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. 
// In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note 
// with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
